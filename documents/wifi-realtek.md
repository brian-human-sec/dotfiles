rtl8811cu/rtl8821cu
rtl8821cu-dkms-git AUR provides a kernel module for the Realtek 8811cu and 8821cu chipset.

This requires DKMS, so make sure you have your proper kernel headers installed.

If no wireless interface shows up even though the 8821cu module is loaded, you may need to manually specify the rtw_RFE_type option [8][9]. Try e.g. rtw_RFE_type=0x26, other values might also work. See Kernel module#Setting module options for details.

rtl8821ce
rtl8821ce-dkms-gitAUR provides a kernel module for the Realtek 8821ce chipset found in the Asus X543UA.

This requires DKMS, so make sure you have your proper kernel headers installed.

Note: It has been reported [10] that the default rtl8821ce module provided by Realtek is broken for Linux kernel â‰¥ 5.9, which may lead to low connectivity. The AUR version above should be preferred. See the statement on GitHub.
